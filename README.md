Take-home Interview Exam

TESTING NOTES:

The /dist folder should contain the compiled static content that can be placed in a webserver

The /src folder should contain the source code

I have not included the node_modules folder so to run or debug this locally, please make sure angular cli is installed and run:

npm install

ng serve
